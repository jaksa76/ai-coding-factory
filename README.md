# AI Coding Factory

This project is inspired by the concept of the **AI Coding Factory** as described in the blog post: [AI Coding Factories](https://jaksa.wordpress.com/2025/08/07/ai-coding-factories/).

## What is an AI Coding Factory?

An AI Coding Factory is a new paradigm in software development where autonomous AI agents collaborate to deliver features at unprecedented speed and scale, under human supervision. The process is modeled as a relentless conveyor belt of code, where tasks are pulled from project management tools (like Jira) and processed through sophisticated coding pipelines that produce a working ephemeral environment ready for approval.
Note: The Hub component now runs an Express server in `hub/src/`. Use `npm --prefix hub start` to run it locally.
